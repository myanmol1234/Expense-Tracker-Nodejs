# Expense-Tracker-Nodejs
Hey this is ANMOL GOYAL and i have made this project to track expenses of the users using the nodejs, expressjs as server and mysql as database.
flow is like this : Initially user has to signup and then he will be redirected to login page. once the user is login successfully , a expense tracker dashboard will get opened for him. and using that dashboard user can add his expenses.

inside the server , we are using node js framwework express js to simply the server side logics, and features like routes to filter path and controllers to make code easy and then sequelize to map to our mysql database using sync function.

thanks !!
